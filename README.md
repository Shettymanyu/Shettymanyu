## What I’m doing here (and why)
I’m using GitHub to:
- Learn by building and documenting my journey
- Keep my projects in one place for better understanding and version control
- Get feedback from others and improve
- Stay accountable with a public learning log

## Currently learning
- Python fundamentals and scripting
- Cybersecurity basics and practical labs
- Git and GitHub workflows (branching, commits, PRs, issues)

## What’s next
- Automating small security tasks with Python
- Publishing more practice projects as I migrate them
- Writing short notes on what I learn

Thanks for stopping by! If you have tips or ideas, I’m all ears.
